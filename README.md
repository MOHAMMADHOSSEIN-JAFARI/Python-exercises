# Calculating twice the vice versa of a 3-digit number
Write a program that reads a three-digit number from the input and prints twice the vise versa of digits in the output. You can be sure that the input must be a three-digit number. For example, if the number 765 is typed in the input, print the number 567 * 2, ie 1134, in the output.
# Finding the next number which is multiple of 10 after an input number 
Write a program that reads an input number and prints the next first multiple of 10, which is greater than this number. For example, if the number 11 was read from the input, the number 20 should be printed. If the number 40 is read, the number 50 should be printed.
# Finding Prime Number
In this program, read a positive number from the input and determine whether this number is prime or not.
If it was a prime number, print prime in the output, and if it was not a prime number, print not prime in the output. Please make sure the output is exactly as stated. 
# Working with strings
Saman's just learned the strings. There's a fairly simple question ahead of him to get started with the strings, but he needs your help to do it. Saman should write the program to read a string of words from the entrance and make the following changes to it.

1- Erase all vowels.

2. Print a dot before each silent letter.

3. Write all the remaining silent letters in small numbers.
(Vowels are aeiou)
# Summing Up Numbers
Somayeh is studying in second grade and is just learning to collect numbers. The class teacher wrote some numbers on the board, and the students had to count the sum of the numbers. To make it easier, the numbers that need to be summed up are just one and two and three. But that's not enough, and students can only do the plural when the numbers are arranged in a non-descending order (i.e. first one, then twos and then threes) you have to read the phrase that the teacher wrote at the foot of the board as input and generate the phrase that was explained in the output so that Somayeh and the other students can count it.
#  Standardization of Names
Mehdi is sending the final list of the names of the participants in the closing ceremony of fajr film for the executive committee so that they can print the entry cards. But there's something wrong. The participants didn't write their names as standard when they registered. Standard means exactly the first letter of the uppercase letter and the rest is lowercase. Write a program that reads 10 names from the input and prints them standardized in the output.
# Sarah Greets
Sarah has just learned to type and log on to the Internet. Once he got online, he decided to go into a chatroom and say hello to everyone. Sarah put a word into the chatroom.

It is guaranteed that the entry consists only of lowercase English letters.
