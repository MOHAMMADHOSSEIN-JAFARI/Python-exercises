# Calculating twice the vice versa of a 3-digit number
Write a program that reads a three-digit number from the input and prints twice the vise versa of digits in the output. You can be sure that the input must be a three-digit number. For example, if the number 765 is typed in the input, print the number 567 * 2, ie 1134, in the output.
# Finding the next number which is multiple of 10 after an input number 
Write a program that reads an input number and prints the next first multiple of 10, which is greater than this number. For example, if the number 11 was read from the input, the number 20 should be printed. If the number 40 is read, the number 50 should be printed.
# Finding Prime Number
In this program, read a positive number from the input and determine whether this number is prime or not.
If it was a prime number, print prime in the output, and if it was not a prime number, print not prime in the output. Please make sure the output is exactly as stated. 
# Working with strings
Saman's just learned the strings. There's a fairly simple question ahead of him to get started with the strings, but he needs your help to do it. Saman should write the program to read a string of words from the entrance and make the following changes to it.

1- Erase all vowels.

2. Print a dot before each silent letter.

3. Write all the remaining silent letters in small numbers.
(Vowels are aeiou)
