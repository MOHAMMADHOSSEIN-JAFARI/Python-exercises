# Calculating twice the vice versa of a 3-digit number
Write a program that reads a three-digit number from the input and prints twice the vise versa of digits in the output. You can be sure that the input must be a three-digit number. For example, if the number 765 is typed in the input, print the number 567 * 2, ie 1134, in the output.
# Finding the next number which is multiple of 10 after an input number 
Write a program that reads an input number and prints the next first multiple of 10, which is greater than this number. For example, if the number 11 was read from the input, the number 20 should be printed. If the number 40 is read, the number 50 should be printed.
# Finding Prime Number
In this program, read a positive number from the input and determine whether this number is prime or not.
If it was a prime number, print prime in the output, and if it was not a prime number, print not prime in the output. Please make sure the output is exactly as stated. 
# Working with strings
Saman's just learned the strings. There's a fairly simple question ahead of him to get started with the strings, but he needs your help to do it. Saman should write the program to read a string of words from the entrance and make the following changes to it.

1- Erase all vowels.

2. Print a dot before each silent letter.

3. Write all the remaining silent letters in small numbers.
(Vowels are aeiou)
# Summing Up Numbers
Somayeh is studying in second grade and is just learning to collect numbers. The class teacher wrote some numbers on the board, and the students had to count the sum of the numbers. To make it easier, the numbers that need to be summed up are just one and two and three. But that's not enough, and students can only do the plural when the numbers are arranged in a non-descending order (i.e. first one, then twos and then threes) you have to read the phrase that the teacher wrote at the foot of the board as input and generate the phrase that was explained in the output so that Somayeh and the other students can count it.
#  Standardization of Names
Mehdi is sending the final list of the names of the participants in the closing ceremony of fajr film for the executive committee so that they can print the entry cards. But there's something wrong. The participants didn't write their names as standard when they registered. Standard means exactly the first letter of the uppercase letter and the rest is lowercase. Write a program that reads 10 names from the input and prints them standardized in the output.
# Sarah Greets
Sarah has just learned to type and log on to the Internet. Once he got online, he decided to go into a chatroom and say hello to everyone. Sarah put a word into the chatroom.

# Meet Nowruz
On the occasion of Nowruz, three old friends want to meet. Azarmehr, Azargoon and Mehr aein plan to meet at one point. The house of these three is located on the right line (axis x) of the house of Azarmehr is located at the x1 point, the house of Azargon is located at the point x2, and mehraein house is located at the x3 point. Overall, they want to travel the lowest distance. With x1 x2 x3 holding, calculate the lowest distance these three have to go through in total to meet at one point. Please print it without decimal point if the answer is integer, for example, in the example below, if you print 6.0 is incorrect.
Note that the distance is desired, not where they are supposed to meet.
Sample input:
6 9 10
Sample output:
4
# Small Letters Capital Letters
Ariamanesh (darius's son's name) is very upset that on the Internet, people use capital letters and small letters when they write a word. That's why he decided to write a browser that would write words with small letters and capital letters in a new way, so that if a word had more capital letters than the number of small letters, it would write the whole word in capital letters, otherwise it would write the whole word in small letters.


Sample input:

hasTAM
Sample output:

hastam
Is Palindrome?
Zargiso, who has just become familiar with programming, wants to write a program that determines whether a word is a palindrome. It's called a palindrome, whether you read it from the left or from the right. Madam, for example, is a palindrome, but tehran is not a palindrome. Now you have to help Zargiso write this program.
Please note that the small or large letters do not matter as we said Madam is a palindrome as maDAM is a palindrome.

Input sample:

madam
Output sample:

palindrome
 

Input sample:

tehran
Output sample:

not palindrome
 # Substring
 Jahangir works at a computer company. Jahangir is going to write a program that determines whether AB and BA can be found in another discipline without overlap. Ab and BA don't matter either. I mean, if it's ABBA input, there's a YES answer. If there's a BAAB entry, there's still a YES answer. But if it's an ABA entry, there's a NO answer, or if it's an ABHA entry, there's a NO answer. Can you help Jahangir write this program?

Please print YES and NO exactly the same way with capital letters in the output.

At the given sample entry, players who have played 5 and 4 games cannot be in the group according to the question, so only 4 players who have played 0, 2, 1 and 0 can be in groups. With 4 persons, only one group of 3 persons can be formed. Note that you don't have to count the number of modes (permutations).
